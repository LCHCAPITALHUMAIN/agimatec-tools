#summary database import framwork

= Introduction =

A small framework with tools for csv-file, fixed-length-file or xml-file imports.
An importer can be implemented without any additional configuration. You just implement a java-class that uses some of the utility classes or - even better - write a groovy-script.

Some of the utility classes are designed for simple usage from within groovy.
