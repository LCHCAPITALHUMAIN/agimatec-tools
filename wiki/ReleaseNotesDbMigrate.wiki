}}}

  * New grails plugin to integrate dbmigrate into a grails project: http://code.google.com/p/viaboxx-dbmigrate/. 
  * dbmigrate works also when all scripts and configs are packaged in a jar or war archive (former releases only supported file: access. this release supports classpath access with the cp: protocol)
