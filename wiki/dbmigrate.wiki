#summary database migration tool

= Introduction =

You can use the dbmigrate tool to manage the creation and evolution of one or more databases. It supports postgres and oracle explicitly, but should run with any JDBC database. With this tool, you can set up a project with scripts (e.g. SQL) to create the database and put some scripts to upgrade to higher version in another directory. 

Normally you write a configuration to setup the database from scratch and another configuration to upgrade to higher versions. In upgrade-mode, the tool executes all upgrade scripts that are required.

Look into the example to get an impression quickly or to use the example as a starting project for your own database.

Look into the detailed documentation to learn the configuration and other features.
