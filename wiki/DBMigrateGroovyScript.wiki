#summary features for groovy scripts

The tool can execute files with suffix .groovy as  [http://groovy.codehaus.org/ groovy scripts].

It does not make any difference whether you invoke a groovy script from within a xml configuration or directly by placing it in the scripts directory (prefix up-) for automatic invocation, except that you cannot provide additional parameters when invoking the script automatically.

Important hints:
Groovy scripts are compiled to classes as well. The naming of the scripts might be important:
  * do not prefix them with "up-", because script name must no contain "-".
    Solution: configure "Scripts-Prefix" = "up_"
  * use "_" in the version format instead of ".", because "." indicates a package path in the script name, which might lead to surprising side effects
    Solution: name your scripts in format "up_1_0_0_myscript.groovy" instead "up-1.0.0_myscript.groovy"
