= Introduction =

agimatec-tools contains 3 frameworks, more or less independent of each other:

  * [dbmigrate DBMigrate], if you need a framework for database migration or other tools contained in dbmigrate (e.g. sql script execution, schema transformation, code generation sql->java) (see [DBMigrateWhy Why use dbmigrate and who can use it])

 * [dbimport DBImport], if you need to import data from excel, csv, fixed-length, xml files/streams
 
  * [annomark Annomark], if you want to generate source code or other files (properties, xml) driven by annotations

and - on a separate side -
  * [NLSTools], if you want to manage resource bundles with XML/excel, generate properties for Java and Adobe Flex, SQL, merge etc.

You can 
  * use dbimport without any other agimatec framework.
  * use dbmigrate (and optionally dbimport from within some of your scripts)
  * use annomark, but this requires dbmigrate in the classpath as well (because annomark uses some common-utility classes from dbmigrate)
